    </p>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

            <li>Mix thyme, salt, and black pepper in a small bowl and rub the mixture over both sides of brisket.</li>
            
            <li>Heat olive oil in a roasting pan over medium-high heat; place brisket in the hot oil and brown on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove brisket from pan and set aside.</li>
            
            <li>Place red onion slices into the hot roasting pan and cook and stir until onion is slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in beef broth, tomato sauce, and wine.</li>
            
            <li>Place the brisket back into the roasting pan and cover pan with foil.</li>
            
            <li>Roast the brisket in the preheated oven for 1 hour; remove foil and baste brisket with pan juices. Place foil back over roasting pan and roast brisket until very tender and pan sauce has thickened, 1 1/2 to 2 more hours.</li>
        </ol>
